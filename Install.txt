Cubical v1.0 and above uses the CMake buildsystem.
The autoconf build system has been removed and is no longer supported.

Please see the comments at the top of CMakeLists.txt for
the available configuration options you can pass to cmake.

The installation directory defaults to /usr/local on UNIX
and c:/Program Files on Windows.  You can change this by
passing -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path to cmake.

To build a debug version pass -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug to cmake.

To build libical you will need:
 - CMake version 2.8.12 or higher
 - Perl
 - libicu (not required but strongly recommended)
 - a C compiler (let us know if the build fails with your C compiler)

Building on Unix with gcc or clang:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

Building on Windows with MicroSoft Visual Studio:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
% nmake
% nmake install

Building on Windows with mingw:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
% mingw32-make
% mingw32-make install

Building on Windows under Cygwin:
% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make
% make install

To run the test suite, from inside the build directory
run 'make test' (or 'nmake test' or 'mingw32-make test')

To run the test suite in verbose mode, pass ARGS="-V" to the make command
For example: nmake test ARGS="-V"
